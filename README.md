Lazer Tag ++ Pro Max
These are component files in use for a human activity recognition machine learning model training and implementation.

The following folders contain the various components scripts and data:
1) Data_v2: The final data that the model was trained on
2) FPGA Classification: The scripts to use in classifying data using the FPGA
3) HLS Files: THe final HLS cpp code used to generate Vivado HDL code
4) ML Training: The python scipts used to manipulate and transform features and the training Jupyter notebook for machine learning
5) Preliminary Test Data: Test data that the initial prototype model was trained on
6) capstone_raw_data: Test data that the second prototype model was trained on
